# CaliburnMicroProjectTemplate
A Caliburn.Micro project template for Windows 10

DISCLAIMER: I'm a beginner in open source, so I'm aware that the code I write may not be suitable for all Caliburn.Micro projects, but I'm very happy to hear your suggestions and accept your pull requests!

This project template allows you to skip the setup of Caliburn.Micro and start coding directly. The project also contains tools and helpers which might help you, in the form of services that can be included in view models via constructor injection.
